This module requires Perl 5.8.0 or later.

Both Pod::Man and Pod::Text are built on Pod::Simple, which handles the
basic POD parsing and character set conversion.  Pod::Simple 3.06 or later
is required (and Pod::Simple 3.07 is recommended).  It is available from
CPAN and part of Perl core as of 5.10.0.

The troff/nroff generated by Pod::Man should be compatible with any troff
or nroff implementation with the `-man` macro set.  It is primarily tested
by me under GNU groff, but Perl users send bug reports for a wide variety
of implementations and Pod::Man is used to generate all of Perl's own
manual pages, so most of the bugs have been weeded out.

The following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if
present:

* Test::MinimumVersion
* Test::Pod
* Test::Spelling
* Test::Strict
* Test::Synopsis

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.
